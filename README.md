## About This Repository
As I dive into this topic, which is entirely new to me, I've initiated a "Total n00b Notebook" (TNN). The TNN is where I document each step of my learning journey, covering my triumphs, struggles, and everything in-between.

### Goals and Expectations
- **Learning**: The primary goal is to learn and understand the complexities of permutation puzzles, particularly as they relate to the Santa 2023 challenge.
- **Solution Submission**: While I aim to submit a solution for the challenge, I'm realistic about the tough competition and my current learning curve.
- **Enjoying the Process**: More than anything, this is about enjoying the learning process and embracing the challenges it presents.

## Contributions
Feel free to explore my TNN and other materials in this repository. I'm open to suggestions, feedback, and collaborative ideas to improve the solution and understanding of this fascinating puzzle.

## Stay Tuned
Watch this space for updates as I progress through the challenge and learn more about permutation puzzles in the realm of competitive programming!
